        <p class="section-sub">CliftonStrengths coach and DEI practitioner for people who know they deserve more.</p>

        <p>I am a CliftonStrengths coach and DEI practitioner who has worked in local, regional and global roles across different sectors. A lot of my work has focused on shifting cultures, policies and systems so that marginalised people can work and live with more dignity.</p>

        <p>In coaching, I bring the same lens to individual careers. We look at your strengths, your story and the power dynamics around you. Then we design moves that fit your context and your nervous system, not just some generic success template.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 1.8rem;">What I bring to our sessions</h3>
        <ul class="clean-list">
          <li>A deep understanding of how racism, sexism, queerphobia and other systems show up in workplaces.</li>
          <li>Experience across local, regional and global roles, including international NGOs and corporate networks.</li>
          <li>CliftonStrengths tools that give you clear language for your talents and how they create value.</li>
          <li>A direct style with care, humour and zero judgement. We will be honest and also human.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 1.8rem;">My values in coaching</h3>
        <p>I work from three core values: dignity, agency and honesty.</p>
        <ul class="clean-list">
          <li>Dignity means you do not have to earn your place in the room.</li>
          <li>Agency means you always choose your own path. I offer perspective and tools, you keep the final say.</li>
          <li>Honesty means I will not pretend that bias or risk are not there, or that change will feel comfortable all the time.</li>
        </ul>

          <h3>Strengths and social justice in the same room</h3>
          <p>Strengths work is powerful, but it does not live in a vacuum. We combine it with a clear view of how power and identity operate at work, so that your plans are grounded and real.</p>
          <p>We can coach in English or Spanish, across time zones, and around the realities of your life and work.</p>

          <h3>Who I love to work with</h3>
          <ul class="clean-list">
            <li>People from underrepresented or marginalised backgrounds in their field or organisation.</li>
            <li>People who are ready to pivot or to ask for more, even if they feel scared or unsure.</li>
            <li>People who want to claim more power at work without losing themselves in the process.</li>
