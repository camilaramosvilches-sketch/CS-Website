            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hello! I’m Cami, a certified strengths‑based coach dedicated to helping individuals and teams unlock their potential. With a professional background in diversity, equity and inclusion, I’ve seen firsthand how focusing on what makes each person unique fosters engagement and collaboration. I bring this perspective to my coaching practice, creating inclusive spaces where clients feel seen, valued and empowered.</p>
            <p>I became passionate about the CliftonStrengths methodology after witnessing the transformational impact it had on my own development. The assessment provided language to describe my natural talents and helped me shift my energy toward maximizing them. Today I guide others through the same discovery process, using evidence‑based techniques and Gallup’s research to support meaningful growth.</p>

            <h3>My Approach</h3>
            <p>Every engagement begins with curiosity. I work with you to explore your unique strengths profile and understand how your talents influence your behavior. Together we set goals that align with your values, and I provide feedback, tools and accountability to help you develop habits that leverage your strengths. Whether you’re an individual seeking clarity or a team looking to increase collaboration, my coaching is tailored to meet you where you are.</p>
