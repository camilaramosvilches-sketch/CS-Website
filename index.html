          CliftonStrengths coaching with a social justice lens
        </div>
        <h2>Coaching for people who are done playing small at work</h2>
        <p>I help people from underrepresented backgrounds use their CliftonStrengths and a social justice lens to pivot, get promoted or finally ask for what they deserve.</p>
        <p class="hero-note">Sessions are online, grounded in DEI practice and built for real workplaces, not fantasy companies.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">How this is different</h2>
        <p class="section-sub">We combine CliftonStrengths tools with DEI practice and social justice thinking. The goal is not to fix you but to shift your position and choices.</p>
        <div class="grid grid-3" style="margin-top: 1.4rem;">
          <div class="card">
            <div class="card-tag">Strengths first</div>
            <h3>Strengths, not flaws</h3>
            <p>We start from your CliftonStrengths profile and map where you are already powerful. You get language for how you think, feel and work so you can stop apologising for it.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <div class="card-tag">Power aware</div>
            <h3>Systems, not just mindset</h3>
            <p>We talk honestly about bias, politics and power, so you can pick strategies that keep you safe and effective in real organisations, not imaginary fair spaces.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <div class="card-tag">Action focused</div>
            <h3>Action, not endless reflection</h3>
            <p>Every session ends with one clear move. A conversation, an email, a boundary, a decision. Small steps that build momentum instead of more overthinking.</p>
