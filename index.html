            <h3>Why Strengths‑Based Coaching?</h3>
            <p>Conventional development often focuses on fixing weaknesses, but decades of research by Gallup suggest a different approach. The CliftonStrengths assessment identifies your natural patterns of thinking, feeling and behaving so you can intentionally invest in them. Focusing on strengths rather than weaknesses encourages a positive mindset and can significantly boost engagement and productivity. Leaders who invest in strengths create teams where individuals contribute their unique talents, complementing one another to achieve shared goals.</p>
            <p>Working with a strengths coach helps you gain deeper self‑awareness and accountability. Through structured conversations, a coach can highlight blind spots and guide you to overcome obstacles. Discussing your challenges using a common strengths language builds understanding and cooperation, especially when working with diverse teams.</p>
